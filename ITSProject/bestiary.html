                <td>Manticoil</td>
                <td>Manticoils are a passerine bird of the family Corvidae. Their bodies are quite large compared to their early descendants, and their wingspan ranges from 55 to 64 inches. Their most defining characteristic is their set of four wings.</td>
                <td>Manticoils are generally docile and do not interact with players as of yet. They pose no threat to safety.</td>

                <td>Hoarding Bug</td>
                <td>Hoarding bugs (of the order Hymenoptera) are large, social insects. While often found living alone, they have been found to share their nests with members of their own species. They measure a height of 3 feet on average, with bulbous bodies.</td>
                <td>Keeping your distance and refraining from stealing from Hoarding Bugs will prevent them from targeting you, as they take upwards of 3 seconds of near-collision with a player before becoming hostile.</td>

                <td>Snare Flea</td>
                <td>A very large arthropod of the class Chilopoda. Its body produces a silk which it primarily uses to propel itself to places where it is concealed. Its exoskeleton is somewhat fragile, and they can die from long falls.</td>
                <td>Watch the ceiling for Snare Fleas; they can be identified with the Echo Scanner.</td>

                <td>Bracken</td>
                <td>There is debate on the genus to which the Bracken belongs. It is a bipedal vertebrate with skin the color and texture of a red beet. The name is coined for what appear to be leaves protruding from its upper spine.</td>
                <td>It can be spooked if looked at quickly without staring, but will attack if stared at for roughly 4-5 seconds.</td>

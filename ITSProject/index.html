            <p>There are many things that you will not understand when you enter the company. This is why this database will serve as your guide as you complete quotas in the company.</p>
            <p>This database will inform you with everything you need to know, from the scraps you will be colleting to the unknown entities you will encounter.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>For starters, here are several things you need to keep in mind when you are working in the company:</p>
            <div class="image">
                <img src="img/scrap.jpg" style="height: 100%; width: 50%"></img>
            </div>
            <p>First, you are tasked to collect scraps from abandoned moons to be sold for the company for money, the same money that you will need to complete quotas.</p>
            <p>And speaking of "quotas", it is required that you must complete it within the given timeframe; Because if you don't, <b>a disciplinary action will be exectued</b>.</p>
            <p>It is also important to proceed through the moons with caution. The moons are filled with hazardous environments that when if not taken into consideration, may lead to serious injuries or death.</p>
            <div class="image">
                <img src="img/snareflea.jpg" style="height: 100%; width: 50%"></img>
            </div>
            <p>There are records of workers who reported to the company of strange entities that are lurking within the moons. This was presumed as just halluncinations. Regardless, remain sharp, especially when inside facilities.</p>
            <p>If unwanted death incidents were to occur during the operation, immidately contact the company. They will provide the necessary instructions in carrying out the retrieval of the body and will send out a replacement crew member.</p>

            </div>
            <p><strong>The company is not responsible to unforseen circumstances, specifically the loss of life of an individual, as per stated in Section A-3445 in the Company handbook.</strong></p>
            <p>Happy working! :D</p>
